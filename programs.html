      <h1>Programs & Activities of PROSA</h1>

      <p>Advocacy & Student Rights:

        PROSA frequently raises issues affecting students — for example, they criticized the University of Liberia
        administration on student welfare matters, showing up at press events to call for more transparency.


        They have publicly condemned policies or decisions they see as harmful to students. For instance, they strongly
        criticized the launch of PhD programs at UL, arguing that more fundamental student needs were not being
        addressed.



        They also push for financial transparency, especially in how student fees are used — e.g., they raised concerns
        over fees for student ID cards.



        National & Social Justice Activism:

        PROSA doesn’t just focus on campus issues — they engage in national-level advocacy. For example, they have
        organized (or planned) marches to protest corruption.

        They also mobilize around broader social issues: in July 2025, they scheduled a nationwide march against sexual
        and gender-based violence (SGBV).


        Their activism extends to holding the government accountable. In one statement, they condemned alleged bribery
        by high-level officials and called out corruption in national institutions.

        Press Engagement & Media Presence:

        PROSA often holds press conferences to communicate their positions both on student-specific issues and national
        matters.



        The New Republic Liberia:

        They also use social media (e.g., Facebook) to mobilize support, announce activities, and articulate their
        mission.




        Political Representation on Campus:

        PROSA is formally recognized as a campus-based political party at the University of Liberia.


        They participate in student governance, representing student interests and pushing for reforms.



        Confronting Security/Police Issues:

        They have also publicly challenged security forces. For example, PROSA “growled” at the Liberia National Police
        for what they described as harsh handling of students.



        Solidarity & Mobilization:

        PROSA organizes solidarity actions. One such activity is their march for fire victims — they called for a “Long
        March” to draw attention to fire disaster victims and to urge government and humanitarian interventions.



        They also tie their marches to broader political mobilization (“Avant-garde party” framing), indicating they see
        themselves not just as a student group but as a political movement.
