          <div class="mission-icon">⚖️</div>
          <h3>Egalitarianism</h3>
          <p>dvocacy for Student Welfare & University Governance:

            PROSA raises issues about student welfare— including fees for student ID cards, lack of classroom resources.


            They demand transparency and accountability in the university’s financial and administrative management.
            theliberianpost.com

            Social Justice & Economic Emancipation:

            They identify with “economic emancipation,” calling out corruption and misallocation of public funds.





            They protest governmental issues such as bribery in the legislature.


            Human Rights & Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Activism:

            PROSA organizes nationwide marches against rape and gender-based violence.



            We demand justice system reforms, including better investigations and faster legal processes for GBV
            survivors.


            We push for public education on consent and survivor-centered policies.


            Academic Integrity & Quality of Education:

            PROSA criticized the University of Liberia for launching PhD programs without addressing more urgent
            challenges like lack of proper labs or class infrastructure.


            They argue that the administration is prioritizing prestige (e.g., launching doctoral programs) over real,
            foundational student needs.
            liberianinvestigator.com

            Mobilization & Political Engagement:

            We are a “campus-based political movement / party,” using protest and civic action to
            influence both university and national policy.



            They organize marches not just for campus issues but national crises (“March for Fire Victims”).
            on April 19, 2024


            PROSA also engages in calls for systemic change, connecting student issues with broader questions of
            governance, social justice, and economic policy.</p>
